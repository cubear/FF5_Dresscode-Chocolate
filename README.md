# FF5_Dresscode-Chocolate
Unique per-job overworld sprites for final fantasy 5 (SNES)

Dresscode Chocolate is an espansion over the prior dresscode.
With a couple of small concessions, it is now possible to have the battle palettes loaded onto the map screens in order for job costumes to retain the correct colours between battle and field modes.

All sprites have gotten at least a small upgrade compared to the original dresscode, in both colour depth and aesthetics

Furthermore, all injection of assets and palettes can now be done with asar.

An IPS patch will be included, but please expand your rom to 4 megabytes (32 megabit HiROM) before applying to ensure maximum compatibility.
